This includes links to the National Climate Change Response Database (NCCRD), links to the Declared Disasters database maintained by NDMC, and a facility to supplement events and impacts with media uploaded from phones. Data can also be contributed via our links to SASDI (South African Spatial Data Infrastructure).</span></div>

              <div class="collapsible-body"><span>The National Climate Change Response Dataabase, hosted by DEA, provides officials with the opportunity to record mitigation and adaptation projects in their administrative area. This information, combined with  options for mitigation and adaptation, allows assessment of future plans. Feasible options include projects identified in the BioEnergy Atlas, while options identified by international donors and the national government are also listed. We reflect Working for Water projects, as well as licenses gramted by NERSA for renewable energy.</span></div>

Metadata contributed to SASDI can be leveraged for inclusion into Profiling Tools and Atlases (with certain requirements in respect of the underlying datasets), and data contributed to SARVA can be marked for inclusion into SASDI. Either way, data will be mutually useful. </span>
