          <p>South Africa covers an area of 121,9 million hectares (ha), of which over 80% (100 million ha) is used for agriculture. This includes commercial timber plantations that cover approximately 1,3 million ha of the country, constituting more or less 1,1% of South Africaâ€™s forest land. Of the 80% land surface area used for agriculture in South Africa, only 12% of the country has arable potential. The remaining 68% is suitable mainly for extensive livestock farming.</p>

          <p>During the past decade, South Africa has entered into a new era with regard to air quality management. The National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act (Act No.39 of 2004) (the AQA) came into full effect in 2010, and signalled a paradigm shift in air quality management from a source-based toward a receiving environment approach. In order to give effect to this act, significant measures have been implemented to tackle the air pollution challenges that the country faces.</p>

          <p>SARVA provides access to a range biodiversity data, inter alia from <a href="">old</a> and <a href="">new</a> versions of BGIS (SANBI) and studies conducted by CSIR, SAIAB, and SAEON. The biodiversity section in the first edition of SARVA (Midgely 2011) introduced the exceptionally rich biota of South Africa. It included maps of the main areas of endemism (i.e. places where there are concentrations of species that do not occur naturally anywhere else in the world) and of the protected area network that has been established to conserve biodiversity. Furthermore, it outlined the threat to biodiversity posed by land use and climate change, and presented a case study of the Kruger-to-Canyons area in the northeast of the country. This chapter builds on that foundation without repeating the information.</p>

          <p>South Africa has approximately 278 municipalities which are spread across the nine provinces, categorised as either metropolitan (8), district (44), or local municipalities (226). The sensitivity and exposure of these municipalities to global and climate change varies, with some municipalities having low adaptive capacity due to their vulnerability context which is characterised by low income, lack of skilled human capacity, poor primary healthcare, lack of basic infrastructure, and degraded ecosystems.</p>

          <p>Climate change and human-induced environmental change do not impact on the South African marine and coastal ecosystems in isolation. Typically, one aggravates the other. Climate change is adding increasingly more pressure to coastal and ocean ecosystems, and the ability of the South African marine environment to (1) withstand the impacts of climate change and other environmental perturbations, and (2) to continue to provide us with its resources, will be determined by the overall health of the marine environment.</p>

          <p>The primary responsibility for disaster management and risk reduction in South Africa rests with Government as identified in the Constitution (RSA 1996). The Disaster Management Act (DMA) and the National Disaster Management Framework (NDMF) are the centrepiece legislation regulating the provision of disaster management services (RSA 2002; 2005). The aim of the DMA is to ensure a uniform and integrated approach to disaster management and disaster risk reduction in each and across all spheres of government involving all relevant stakeholders. The National Disaster Management Centre (NDMC) was established to promote this integrated and coordinated system of disaster management with the emphasis on prevention and mitigation (RSA 2002).</p>

          <p>Commercial forestry in South Africa consists of highly managed planted blocks of even-aged, single species trees. South African plantation forests occupy an area of approximately 1.3 million hectares (ha) of which 80% is found in the provinces of Mpumalanga, KwaZulu-Natal and the Eastern Cape (DAFF 2010). Plantations are dominated by three exotic genera: Pinus (52.5%), Eucalyptus (39.1%) and Acacia (7.6%), and these are mainly grown for the production of pulp (66.7%), saw logs (25.3%) and mining timber (3.1%) (DAFF 2010). Plantation forestry plays a significant role in the countryâ€™s economy and contributes 0.2% to the total gross domestic product (GDP) from areas where economic alternatives are limited (Chamberlain et al. 2005). Forestry also provides a livelihood for many rural households through the direct employment of low-skilled workers as well as support to small growers     schemes.</p>

          <p>The total volume of available groundwater in South Africa is estimated at 10 343 Mm3/a. This total available volume is known as the Utilisable Groundwater Exploitation Potential (UGEP). The UGEP volume reduces to 7 500 Mm3/a in conditions of drought (DWA 2010). The latter figure has been suggested as the sustainable potential yield that may be used for planning purposes in the rural, domestic, municipal, industrial, and agricultural water use sectors (DWA 2012b). Although the volumes of existing groundwater use are uncertain, the Department of Water Affairs (DWA) estimates that only between 3 000 and 4 000 Mm3/a of groundwater is currently being used (DWA 2012a), thus allowing for the possibility to potentially expand groundwater use. Potential expansion should be conducted carefully and subject to proper planning, siting, management and resource protection. The distribution of utilisable groundwater available in drought conditions is shown in Figure 1. The values used in this map were derived as part of the Groundwater Resource Assessment Phase 2.</p>

          <p>Cities, towns and settlements provide housing and livelihoods for a growing global population. Estimates indicate that in 2014, 54% of the worldâ€™s population and 40% of the population on the African continent were considered urban. African city growth rates are amongst the highest in the world and it is estimated that by 2050, 56% of the population in Africa will be living in urban settlements. Aside from hosting the majority of the worldâ€™s population, urban settlements generally provide a wide range of livelihoods and services for their residents and its surrounding areas, provide economies of scale in production, ease of information flow, large markets for goods and labour, and offer greater opportunities for education, healthcare, social cohesion and trade.</p>

          <p>South Africaâ€™s surface water resources are naturally limited and unevenly distributed. Over the years, South Africaâ€™s rivers have been highly developed and utilised, and in many instances over-exploited. South Africa relies primarily on surface water for water supply, with more than 66% of the countryâ€™s total mean annual runoff (MAR), of approximately 49 000 million cubic meters per annum, currently being stored in reservoirs. The remaining opportunities for the development of surface water resources are situated far from centres of demand and in relatively remote areas, limiting the feasibility of surface water development due to high construction and energy costs required to transport water. Given South Africaâ€™s continued population growth, ever-growing urban areas and economic development, as well as the continued degradation of our natural resource base, easily accessible surface water and its remaining development potential will be insufficient in the near future.</p>

          <p>South Africa is associated with a variety of different weather phenomena. These include thunderstorms over the Highveld, frontal rain over the south-western Cape, berg wind conditions (and their often associated coastal low pressure systems), frost and snow during the winter months, and wide-spread flooding caused by intense cutoff low pressure systems, or even by tropical cyclones making landfall. When these weather conditions are organised into unique clusters, vastly different climatological regions are identified. For example, the south-western Cape receives most of its rainfall during winter, while the interior area of the country is a predominantly summer rainfall area. Over the east of the country, the mid-summer months are the wettest, while over the western parts most of the rainfall is received during late summer and autumn.</p>

          <p>Currently, public health in South Africa is in a unique situation with a quadruple burden of disease, with HIV/Aids, communicable diseases, non-communicable diseases, and injuries all contributing greatly toward this burden of disease. This quadruple burden not only highlights the high HIV/Aids rate, but also the fact that South Africaâ€™s burden of disease is impacted by those illnesses mainly found in both developing countries (i.e. communicable diseases) and developed countries (i.e. non-communicable diseases, also known as lifestyle diseases). This quadruple burden also puts a stress on the public health sector and climate change could add an additional stressor to this sector.</p>
